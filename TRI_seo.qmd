## **🗂️ Data and Source**

The data used in this project came from two primary sources:

1. Screaming Frog SEO Spider – to perform a technical audit of client's website pages, identifying issues such as duplicate content and readability.
2. Google Analytics – to evaluate user behavior on key pages, including bounce rate, and time on page, helping us prioritize which pages needed the most content improvement.
We focused on pages with high traffic but low engagement or structural issues, and used these insights to guide SEO and content enhancement recommendations.

## **❓ Objectives**

**Content analysis and optimization**

- Identify the content with hard readability and low engagement

- Optimize content structure with keywords and enhance the engagement

- Create FAQ section to help users know the client better

## **⚙️ Approach**

- Ran technical audit using **Screaming Frog** SEO Spider and **Google Analytics**

- Evaluated readability and structure for the pages with big issues

- Suggested keyword placement, CTA formatting, and content structure

## **❗️Limitations**

- The FAQ was created based on anticipated user questions, as there was no historical database of actual user inquiries

- A/B testing was not conducted, so the effectiveness of individual changes was not validated quantitatively

## **📈 Results**

- Created a Google sheet with each pages recommendations based on the analytic result

- Created a page-level SEO checklist adopted by client’s team
