This section showcases digital marketing projects where I applied strategic thinking, consumer analysis, and creative execution:

-   **Coffee Shop Marketing Strategy** â€“ A segmentation-focused project that analyzes post-pandemic coffee consumer behavior using clustering and predictive modeling (in progress)

-   **Local Brand Social Media Growth** â€“ A campaign-based project that improved a local brandâ€™s online presence, achieving a 65% increase in followers and 583% growth in post reach

These projects demonstrate my ability to connect data, creativity, and planning in real-world marketing scenarios.
