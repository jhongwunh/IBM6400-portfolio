*Status: Still in progress*

This project explores how consumer behaviors toward coffee have shifted post-pandemic. The goal is to segment coffee consumers based on psychological and behavioral patterns, enabling more personalized and *effective marketing strategies*.

## 🔍 Objectives

-   Segment consumers using health awareness, risk perception, and behavior data
-   Identify key clusters with distinct coffee preferences or safety concerns
-   Provide recommendations for targeting each segment more effectively

## ⚙️ Methods

-   K-means clustering on psychological and behavioral variables
-   Predictive modeling (Random Forest) to validate clusters
-   Demographic profiling using `gtsummary` tables
-   Visualizations with Likert-scale distributions and stacked bar charts

## 📊 Data & Tools

-   Dataset: COVID-19 consumer behavior survey (N = 736)
-   Tools: R (tidyverse, cluster, gtsummary, ggplot2)
-   Clustering based on 70% of data, predictive modeling on 30%

## 📈 Preliminary Findings

-   Two primary segments: cautious health-aware vs. relaxed indifferent
-   Differences in gender, individualism/collectivism scores, and mask-wearing behavior
-   Behavioral intention patterns vary significantly across segments

## 🧠 Next Steps

-   Refine variable coding for consistency
-   Apply visualization improvements based on user feedback
-   Finalize marketing implications and storytelling dashboard
