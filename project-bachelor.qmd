## Local Brand Social Media Growth

*Apr 2022 – Dec 2022*

## Project Summary

This project was my final marketing project during my undergraduate studies. We collaborated with a local brand that needed to refresh its brand image on social media. After analyzing their social media presence, we developed three key objectives to help achieve this goal:

1.  **Revitalize the brand's social media presence**
2.  **Develop effective engagement strategies**
3.  **Plan content with high engagement potential**

## 📊 Data and Source

Social media performance data collected during my Bachelor's final marketing project, including:

-   Post reach

-   Engagement metrics

-   Follower count changes

-   Target Audience information

## 📌 Managerial Problem

The local brand struggled with a low online presence, flat follower growth, and minimal engagement despite consistent posting.\
The goal was to **strategically grow engagement and visibility** through structured content planning and event-based promotion.

## ❓ Research Questions / Objectives

-   What types of content generate the most engagement?
-   How can a consistent posting schedule affect visibility?
-   What interactive strategies (e.g. holiday campaigns) are most effective?

## 🌟 Results & Impact

-   **65% increase in followers**
-   **583% boost in post reach**
-   Built a monthly post strategy map
-   Added interactive content tied to holidays
-   Created stronger brand recognition online
